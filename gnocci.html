    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat Oven.</strong> Preheat oven to 400 degrees F</li>
        <li><strong>Cook Sausage. </strong> In a large ovenproof skillet, heat the oil over medium-high heat. Add the sausage and brown/crumble until it is cooked through, about 5 minutes. Lower heat to low-medium and add the minced garlic. Saut√© for an additional minute until fragrant. Remove from heat.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Assemble Gnocchi Bake. </strong>In same skillet or transfer to a baking dish, add the gnocchi, marinara, cream, and spices to the sausage and stir to combine. Press into an even layer. Top with cheese.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake. </strong>Bake in preheated oven for about 30 minutes, until gnocchi is tender, sauce is bubbling around the edges and cheese is melted and slightly browned. If the cheese is browning too quickly, you can loosely tent with foil.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve and Enjoy. </strong>Allow to cool for 10 minutes before serving. Top with fresh parsley and enjoy.</li>
    </ol>
